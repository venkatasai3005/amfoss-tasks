# Blog of Installinng ubuntu 22.04 in my PC.

* Actually this is the basic and easy task.but lack of knowledge made me to do lot of mistakes as follows
* 
* while installing the ubuntu first thing we should do is to back up our data for furthur issues.
* i did a mistake by not making backup.
* also i didn't made a free space for partition.
* at the time of partitioning the storage i got strucked and i restarted my pc.
* due to my bad luck my pc got locked by bitlocker.
* by the grace i didnt even have bitlocker recovery in my MS acc.
* so i reinstalled my OS and i did very carefully this time.
* at the second time I made it without sny error.
